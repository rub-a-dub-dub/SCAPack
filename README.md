SCAPack: A Symbolic Circuit Analysis Package for Mathematica
=======
SCAPack is a small, lightweight Mathematica package with the goal of making small-signal analyses of circuits in Mathematica quick and (relatively) painless. I've tried my best to document the package, which is available from within Mathematica, once the package is installed. Installation is easy - take the contents from the release folder and place it into a new folder (maybe called "SCAPack") in your "$AddonsDirectory/Applications", or if you prefer, in the "$UserAddonsDirectory/Applications".
